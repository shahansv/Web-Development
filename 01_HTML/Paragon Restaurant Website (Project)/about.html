                    After initially offering a fusion of the Malabar region's Mappila
                    and Thiyya Cuisines, the master chefs at Paragon have ceaselessly
                    innovated to transform the cuisine over the years. The restaurants
                    reflect the influences from different parts of the world while
                    retaining their traditional roots. They today enjoy cult status in
                    Calicut and Dubai, becoming a part of countless stories, memories
                    and celebrations among our legion of patrons.

                    Hello there, let me start by saying how glad I am to see you here. I
                    won't talk much about the history and vision of Paragon, but just
                    share a few thoughts that take space in my heart and mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My grandfather and father started Paragon in 1939, and my mother ran
                    it after my father's demise. I had the privilege of inheriting it
                    and its legacy. More than Paragon, I inherited their passion. With
                    that I added my vision to share it with the world. All deeply rooted
                    in Calicut's renowned hospitality and the abundant flavours of our
                    'City of Spices'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, Paragon isn't just a restaurant; it's about honouring the
                    traditions that have shaped me, and made me embark on a journey to
                    discover myself and bring to you the finest flavours the world has
                    to offer. Every time we add a new dish, I have my mother's recipes,
                    my father's social versatility, and grandfather's vision, all by me,
                    guiding us to create wonders. Apart from managing, the part that
                    most excites me is when I stumble upon new flavours. I don't know if
                    you will understand this, there is a part of me, deep within, that
                    knows that YES! This can be a hit! I always thank God for it. Once I
                    choose the dish, I further ponder upon and make it better with my
                    esteemed team of chefs. Even if it is a simple dish like a sambar,
                    to fine-tune it and bring it to the level, I have in my mind, it
                    takes a long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can imagine this sounding a little unusual to you, but it's a
                    combination of all this that makes Paragon unique and soulful. Above
                    all, at the end of the day, what gives me assurance that our legacy
                    will live on, is the smile I see on our patrons' faces. Each smile
                    is a testament to the love and tradition we pour into our dishes. It
                    is a reminder that we are not just serving food; we are serving
                    cherished memories, plate after plate.
